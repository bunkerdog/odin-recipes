    <p>Wonderful crusty and chewy pizza dough. Put what you want on it. No skin off my shoes. Enjoy and have fun!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 3/4 cups plus 2 tbsp AP flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups water plus 2 tbsp watm water</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp fine salt</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour and all but 1 tablespoon of the water in a large bowl until just combined, then cover and set aside for 20- 30 minutes to rest. Sprinkle yeast over remaining warm water and set aside to hydrate.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle salt over the surface of the dough. Stir yeast mixture and pour over dough. Lightly wet your hand, reach under the dough, and pull about a fourth of it over the top. Repeat until the center of the dough is covered. Then, using your thumb and fingers as pincers, squeeze and pinch off big chunks of dough. Itâ€™s okay to wet your hand a few times to prevent sticking. Pinch through the dough five to six times, rotating the bowl as needed. Fold the dough over itself a few times. Repeat pinching and folding until the yeast, extra water and salt are fully incorporated and a shaggy dough is formed. Cover the bowl and lest rest about an hour.</li>
        <li>Fold the dough one time to develop the gluten. Lightly wet your hand, reach underneath the dough and pull about a quarter of the dough up just until you feel resistance, then fold it over the center. Rotate the bowl and repeat this folding four to five times, or until the dough has tightened into a ball. Take the entire ball of dough and invert it into a clean, lightly greased bowl, so the seam is down and the top is smooth. Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, 5- 6 hours.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and cut in half. Working with one piece of dough at a time, shape into a ball as follows. Stretch out a quarter of the dough just until you feel resistance, then fold it back over the center. Repeat stretching and folding the remaining three edges until the center is covered and a loose ball is formed. Turn the ball over so the seam is down and place it on an un-floured area. Cup your hands around the dough and gently pull it towards you, dragging the bottom along the counter to create a bit of tension. Rotate the ball 90 degrees and drag it a few inches towards you again. Repeat rotating and gently dragging until the top of the dough tightens up and the ball is round.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a greased plate and repeat with remaining dough. Lightly oil the tops, cover and let rest at room temperature for about an hour. Preheat oven at this time. If not using right away, cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready (for up to 2 days).</li>
