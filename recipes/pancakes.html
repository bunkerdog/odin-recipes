    <h2>Description</h2>   
    <p>Quick, easy and delicious breakfast food. This is a very versatile recipe.
        <br> You can add fruit or chocolate chips (or what have you) to it and transform it completely.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 cup AP flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil or melted butter</li>
    
        </ul>
    </p>    
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>    
        <ol>
            <li>In medium bowl, beat egg with wire whisk until fluffy. Stir in remaining ingredients just until flour is moistened (batter will be slightly lumpy); do not overmix or pancakes will be tough. For thinner pancakes, stir in additional 1 to 2 tablespoons milk.</li>
            <li>Heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat (375Â°F). (To test griddle, sprinkle with a few drops of water. If bubbles jump around, heat is just right.) Brush with vegetable oil if necessary (or spray with cooking spray before heating).</li>
            <li>For each pancake, pour slightly less than 1/4 cup batter onto griddle. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until bubbly on top and dry around edges. Turn; cook other side until golden brown.
            </li>
            
        </ol>
